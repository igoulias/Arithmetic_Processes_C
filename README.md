# Arithmetic_Processes_C

This is a program that is implemented by using both files and pipes. There are actually two versions of the program available, the files that use pipes mention that on their names.

The program can be used to calculate expressions such as "4 < 13 – 5 + 1 && 2 < 1 <= 3"

The first process will calculate the + /– operators, the second process wil calculate the </<=/==/>=/> operators and the last process will calculate the && operator.

For this program mostly system calls were used.
